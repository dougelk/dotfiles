If you would like to use Docker as a non-root user, you should now consider
adding your user to the "docker" group with something like:

  sudo usermod -aG docker your-user

Remember that you will have to log out and back in for this to take effect!



sudo usermod -aG docker dougelk



Verify docker is installed correctly.

Hello from Docker.
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.


To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.


To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash
